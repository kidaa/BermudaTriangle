Hya, Resource Hacker! 

Since you went to all this trouble of looking into the
Galaxis game, I might as well tell you some trivia about
the sounds used in the Galaxis game...

BTW: did you send in the postcard to Barbara?

All sounds (c) 1992 by Christian Franz. 

Sounds were produced using the CEDAR TECHNOLOGIES SID II, 
a great non-profit sound-input device.

Where did I sample those sounds?
