The game "Bermuda Triangle Ship Rescue" is a single-player game. You find
yourself in the Bermuda Triangle. This area is feared by all seafarers
because here many ships disappear for unknown reasons. Recently four
ships have disappeared. You are the captain of a Ship Rescue Enterprise
in search of the lost ships. With your equipment you can move to
any point in the area where the ships may be lost, and you can scan the
water around this point for the wrecks. 
.br
:p.
:hp2.The Gameboard:ehp2.
:p.
The gameboard is a rectangular area (in a future release it will
really be triangular) that consists of 20 x 9 fields :artwork runin
name='field.bmp'. . From each of these fields 
you can scan eight directions (horizontal,
vertical and diagonal). You will then be informed of the number of wrecks
visible from there. This number is shown in that field. 
But be cautious: When two ships are lying one behind the other, the second
one will be hidden behind the first one, so your scanner will only see one ship.
:p.
:hp2.Where is my mousepointer?:ehp2.
:p.
When the mousepointer is on a field of the gameboard, this field is
marked by a grey square&colon.
:p.
:artwork align=center name='s1.bmp'.
:p.
Every action will then be performed on this field.
:p.
:hp2.How to make a move:ehp2.
:p.
A move means a scan on the gameboard.
To make a move, just click with mouse button 1 (normally this is the left
mouse button) on the field you want to scan. 
The lines that lead from this point will be scanned. The result (i. e. the
number of ships the scanning beam has hit) will be displayed
at this position&colon.
:p.
:artwork align=center name='s2.bmp'.
:p.
When you have MMPM installed and you&apos.ve enabled sound in the 
:link reftype=hd refid=PANEL_GAME.Game / Settings...:elink. dialog
window, you will also hear how many ships have been discovered.
This is counted as one move. The number of moves is displayed above the
gameboard. There you also find the number of ships that are still lost.
When you are in the lucky situation that a ship is located where you
did a scan, this does not count as a move.
:p.
When two ships are hidden in a line, you will only be able to see
one! So the gameboard might look like this&colon.
:p.
:artwork align=center name='s7.bmp'.
:p.
From the field with the number one only the lower left ship is visible,
the other ship is hidden behind it.
:p.
:hp2.How to find a ship:ehp2.

:dl.
:dt.
:artwork runin name='ship.bmp'.
:dd.
When you find a ship by clicking on it, this sign is shown. Again, when 
sound is enabled, you will hear a flourish.

:edl.
:p.
:hp2.How do I know which lines will be scanned?:ehp2.
:p.
When you are not sure which lines will be scanned, just move the mouse 
to the desired
field and press the spacebar. The
lines to be scanned will be emphasized&colon.
:p.
:artwork align=center name='s8.bmp'.
:p.
When you move the mouse away from the current field, the lines will disappear.
:p.
:hp2.How to mark a field:ehp2.
:p.
Sometimes you will notice that a certain field can&apos.t contain
a ship (for example any fields visible from a "null" field).
You can then
mark this field by clicking mouse button 2 (normally this is the right
mouse button). A little box :artwork runin name='marksmall.bmp'.will appear 
to indicate that
you marked this field. If you want to remove a mark, just click on the
field again with the right mouse button. 
These markers are just for your convenience and don&apos.t influence
the game in any way.
A field showing a number cannot be
marked,
but a marked field can be scanned. When you want to
mark several fields in a straight line, just drag with the right mouse 
button from 
the first to the last field you want to mark. 
While dragging, a line shows up that indicates which fields will be marked
after you released the mouse button.
Already marked fields are not affected.
:p.
:artwork align=center name='s3.bmp'.
:p.
:hp2.How to hide a scan-number:ehp2.
:p.
When you have analyzed a number you received from a scan, you can hide
this number by clicking on it with the left mouse button. It will turn into an
empty circle&colon.
:p.
:artwork align=center name='s4.bmp'.
:p.
When you click again, the number will reappear.

:dd.Starts a new game. The current game is discarded.

:dt.:hp2.Settings ...:ehp2.
:i2 refid=PANEL_GAME.Settings ...

:dt.Show diagonal lines
:dd.Only the diagonal lines will be displayed on the gameboard.
:dt.Show straight lines
:dd.Only the horizontal and vertical lines will be displayed on the gameboard.

in the file "scores.dat" in the directory where you started the game from.
Of course I encrypted the data a little. This algorithm is very primitive,
but I regard it to be efficient enough (and I don&apos.t expect anybody to spend
much time on decrypting a highscore file). If you are interested in the
encryption method, you can contact
