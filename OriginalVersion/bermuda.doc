Bermuda Triangle Ship Rescue               (C) 1995 Nicole Greiber

This program is a game. You must find ships that are hidden in the
playing area. To get more details, please refer to the online help
(simply press F1).

This package contains the following files:
   bermuda.exe       The program
   bermuda.hlp       The online help
   bermuda.doc       This file
   *.wav             Several sound files. If you don't have MMPM/2 installed
                     or if you don't want sound, you can delete the .wav 
							files.
                     You can also replace the files by your own sounds,
                     as long as they get the same names. If one of
                     the sound files is missing, all sound will be disabled.


The program is released as FREE!ware. If you really like the game
very much, I'd be happy to receive a nice picture postcard of 
your hometown.
